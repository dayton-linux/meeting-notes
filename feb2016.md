Vagrant
-------

- [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [official Ubuntu boxes](https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu) - `vagrant init ubuntu/wily64` for the latest
- [lots of random boxes](http://www.vagrantbox.es/)
- [fedora box](https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/), but you need to actually download the `.box` file, place a copy of the file somewhere, and then `vagrant init path/to/my/.box`
